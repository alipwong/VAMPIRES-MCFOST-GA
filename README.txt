The star class is used to run MCFOST and extract the visibilities from the polarised images.

They key code is located in make-measurements-code.
For a description of the code and example usage see make-measurements-code/making_measurements.pdf (page 10 onwards)

The demo file make-measurements-code/DEMO_make_star.py is a short example of how to use generate the visibilites.
Note that MCFOST and the VAMPIRES data are required to run this, and they are not provided in this repository.
